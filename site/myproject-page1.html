        <p ><b>"The Boy Genius"</b> is an intellectual character whose famous intellect is known throughout the Universe. His story is one which has inspired countless individuals, From his stunning achievement of Graduating from the famous

            Unversity of oxford</a>, at the age of 13, to his solving of the famous unsolvable math problem, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">
              'The Reimann Hypothesis'</a>, at age 15, then onward to his breakthrough in the design of an automated, self recharging smart phone at 20 years old.
          <p> Now 22, The boy Genius has seemingingly settled in as heir to the Famous <b><em>'House of Aden'</em></b> group, which owns several Billion dollars companies globally. However, the world still anticipates several more breakthroughs from him.</p>

              <div class="introbox">       Although known now as the Boy Genius, He was born and christened 'Israel Aden' in a little village in Akwa-Ibom State, Nigeria. From the age of 4, his intellect and comprehension of elementary matters was simply astonishing and Being born into the Rich and Influential Aden Family, his potential was recognized and arrangements were made for his Enrollment into

              He got admitted at just 9 years old which was extremely unusual at the time, and even at present. Despite his young age, he settled in nicely at oxford and graduated four years later with distinction in the department of Maths and Statistics at just 13 years old.</p>
                 <p>Now while other Kids spent their time grumbling about basic Arithmetic, Israel was guided (By his family, no doubt!) to pursue solutions to the 7 Millennium Prize Problems and two years later, at 15, he successfully solved The Reimann Hypothesis. Sources say that he would have eventually solved more of the Millenium Maths problems had he not opted out of the race, to enroll in a high school and be like other Normal teenagers.
            </p>
            <p>After Graduating from highschool 3 years later at 18, he continued life out of the spotlights. however, his freedom and nomalcy was ended one year later at 19, when he was put in charge of Aspacelife Technologies, a multi-million dollar company owned by his family.

              It is to be expected that his achievements as CEO would be outstanding, However, he did more than outstand his peers. at 21 years old, only two years into his administration as CEO, he personally supervised the invention of a technology whose potential threatens to change the workings of the world, all for the better, 'The self recharging Smart device'.
              &nbsp; This &nbsp; tech &nbsp; enables &nbsp; any &nbsp; smart &nbsp; device &nbsp; operated &nbsp; electronically &nbsp; to automatically &nbsp; charge &nbsp; itself &nbsp; as power &nbsp; is &nbsp; expended &nbsp; (#Cool Stuff!).
